Doubly-Linked-List
This repository provides the implementation of a Doubly Linked List (DLL) in C. The operations included in this implementation are:

Insertion: Add nodes at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
Deletion: Remove nodes from the beginning, end, or a specific position, as well as by key.
Traversal: Traverse the list forward and backward.
Count Nodes: Calculate the total number of nodes in the list.
Creation: Create a doubly linked list with a specified number of nodes.
Searching: Search for a specific element in the list.
